# Fifth Project: Neural Optical Character Recognition

Fifth Project for COMP 560: Artificial Intelligence at Bridgewater State University.<br>

The goal of this project is to write a program that can recognize and identify letters. The program should give you a window on which you can draw a letter.  When drawn, it should use a neural network to identify the letter.
